# Telecom Churn Case Study

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for a Telecom Churn Case Study. The notebook demonstrates the process of analyzing customer churn in the telecom industry, leveraging various data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict customer churn.

## Contents

- `Telecom Churn Case Study.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and model building steps.

## Data
The data used in this analysis should be placed in the same directory as the notebook or can be updated in the notebook code cells if located elsewhere. Ensure you have the necessary dataset before running the notebook.

## Analysis Workflow

The notebook is structured as follows:

Data Loading and Exploration:
- Loading the dataset
- Initial exploration and understanding of the data
- Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing data distributions
- Analyzing correlations and relationships

Model Building:
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Building and evaluating machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)

Model Evaluation:
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Handling imbalanced data using techniques such as SMOTE
